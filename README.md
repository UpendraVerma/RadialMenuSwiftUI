# 🎯 SwiftUI Radial Menu with Floating Action Button Animation

This SwiftUI project showcases a beautifully animated **Radial Menu** triggered by a central **Floating Action Button (FAB)** — a modern UI pattern commonly used in mobile apps. Tapping the FAB reveals a circular layout of customizable action buttons, each with smooth animation and clean design.
